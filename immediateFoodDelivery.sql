Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first 
orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.
The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
Output: 
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 50.00                |
+----------------------+
Explanation: 
The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.
The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.
The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.
Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.


SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(ORDER_DATE = CUSTOMER_PREF_DELIVERY_DATE)*100, 2) AS IMMEDIATE_PERCENTAGE
FROM
    DELIVERY
WHERE
    (CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE) IN (
        SELECT
            CUSTOMER_ID,
            MIN(ORDER_DATE)
        FROM
            DELIVERY
        GROUP BY
            CUSTOMER_ID
    );
