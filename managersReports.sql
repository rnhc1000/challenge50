Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |

SELECT E1.name
FROM Employee E1
JOIN (
    SELECT managerId, COUNT(*) AS directReports
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerId
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
) E2 ON E1.id = E2.managerId;
