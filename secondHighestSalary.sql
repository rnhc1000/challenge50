Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. 
If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

SELECT
  IFNULL( (
    SELECT
      DISTINCT SALARY
    FROM
      EMPLOYEE
    ORDER BY
      SALARY DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
  ),
  NULL) AS SECONDHIGHESTSALARY
